dining
======

This project was going to be a better (in my opinion) presentation of UNH's dining hall menus which are posted online.
I thought it was difficult to navigate on a mobile device due to heavy nesting,
so I was going to create a new presentation of the menu data.
I wrote the scraper portion of the project, and right after that they updated the design of their mobile site.

I don't intend to do anything else with this, 
but I think it's cool how most of the scraper could be written in terms of a 
[`reduce`](https://github.com/anthgur/dining/blob/master/src/anthgur/dining/scraper.clj#L165-L175) operation
so I'm going to keep it online.
